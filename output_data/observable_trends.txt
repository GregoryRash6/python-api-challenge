Observable Trends:
1. The strongest r-squared value I found was comparing the Northern Hemisphere’s latitude to the temperatures of cities that correspond. I am most confident saying that as you get farther north from the equator, the average temperature will fall.
2. The r-squared value for the Northern Hemisphere’s latitude to the temperatures of cities that correspond is markedly higher than the same comparison for the Southern Hemisphere. I would want to investigate this further to see why the Northern Hemisphere appears to be more consistent. 
3. The graphs for latitude vs cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed, respectively, have very low r-squared values. The correlation between latitude and these different measures are too low to draw meaningful conclusions.
